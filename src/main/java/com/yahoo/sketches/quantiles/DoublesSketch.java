/**
 * This is a stochastic streaming sketch that enables near-real time analysis of the 
 * approximate distribution of real values from a very large stream in a single pass. 
 * The analysis is obtained using a getQuantiles(*) function or its inverse functions the 
 * Probability Mass Function from getPMF(*) and the Cumulative Distribution Function from getCDF(*).
 * 
 * <p>Consider a large stream of one million values such as packet sizes coming into a network node.
 * The absolute rank of any specific size value is simply its index in the hypothetical sorted 
 * array of values.
 * The normalized rank (or fractional rank) is the absolute rank divided by the stream size, 
 * in this case one million. 
 * The value corresponding to the normalized rank of 0.5 represents the 50th percentile or median
 * value of the distribution, or getQuantile(0.5).  Similarly, the 95th percentile is obtained from 
 * getQuantile(0.95). Using the getQuantiles(0.0, 1.0) will return the min and max values seen by
 * the sketch.</p>
 * 
 * <p>From the min and max values, for example, 1 and 1000 bytes,
 * you can obtain the PMF from getPMF(100, 500, 900) that will result in an array of 
 * 4 fractional values such as {.4, .3, .2, .1}, which means that
 * <ul>
 * <li>40% of the values were &lt; 100,</li> 
 * <li>30% of the values were &ge; 100 and &lt; 500,</li>
 * <li>20% of the values were &ge; 500 and &lt; 900, and</li>
 * <li>10% of the values were &ge; 900.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A frequency histogram can be obtained by simply multiplying these fractions by getN(), 
 * which is the total count of values received. 
 * The getCDF(*) works similarly, but produces the cumulative distribution instead.
 * 
 * <p>The accuracy of this sketch is a function of the configured value <i>k</i>, which also affects
 * the overall size of the sketch. Accuracy of this quantile sketch is always with respect to
 * the normalized rank.  A <i>k</i> of 128 produces a normalized, rank error of about 1.7%. 
 * For example, the median value returned from getQuantile(0.5) will be between the actual values 
 * from the hypothetically sorted array of input values at normalized ranks of 0.483 and 0.517, with 
 * a confidence of about 99%.</p>

 * <p>This is an implementation of the Low Discrepancy Mergeable Quantiles Sketch, using double 
 * values, described in section 3.2 of the journal version of the paper "Mergeable Summaries" 
 * by Agarwal, Cormode, Huang, Phillips, Wei, and Yi. 
 * <a href="http://dblp.org/rec/html/journals/tods/AgarwalCHPWY13"></a></p>
 * 
 * <p>This algorithm is independent of the distribution of values, which can be anywhere in the
 * range of the IEEE-754 64-bit doubles. 
 * 
 * <p>This algorithm intentionally inserts randomness into the sampling process for values that
 * ultimately get retained in the sketch. The results produced by this algorithm are not 
 * deterministic. For example, if the same stream is inserted into two different instances of this 
 * sketch, the answers obtained from the two sketches may not be be identical.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Similarly, there may be directional inconsistencies. For example, the resulting array of 
 * values obtained from getQuantiles(fractions[]) input into the reverse directional query 
 * getPMF(splitPoints[]) may not result in the original fractional values.</p>
